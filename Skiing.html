			I've been skiing In Vermont for as long as I can remember. My dad has a house in Mendon Vermont and I would go up skiing at Pico, Killington, Mt.Snow and Mad River Glenn evry weekend when I was young. I am a member of the Newington Ski club and have ski raced competitively for a couple of years. I plan to be apart of the Ski cub here at UMaine and on going skiing every weekend in the winter. I love all the different types of skiing and have tried them all, Moguls, Racing, Terrain Park. My overall favorite has to be the terrain park and getting big air and grinding on rails and boxes. But I grew up doing moguls and skiing throught the trees at Pico moutain when I was little.
