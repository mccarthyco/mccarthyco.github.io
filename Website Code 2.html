			I've been skiing In Vermont for as long as I can remember. My dad has a house in Mendon Vermont and I would go up skiing at Pico, Killington, Mt.Snow and Mad River Glenn evry weekend when I was young. I am a member of the Newington Ski club and have ski raced competitively for a couple of years. I plan to be apart of the Ski cub here at UMaine and on going skiing every weekend in the winter. I love all the different types of skiing and have tried them all, Moguls, Racing, Terrain Park. My overall favorite has to be the terrain park and getting big air and grinding on rails and boxes. But I grew up doing moguls and skiing throught the trees at Pico moutain when I was little.

				I played Lacroose up until my juinor year of Highschool. I love the feeling of running up field with a stick and ball in hand dodging opponents and going to the cage. I played midfield for three years in highschool. My junior year I was on varisty but didnt get much playing time. Then before my senior season I suffered an ankle injury and decided not to play. I still have the love for the sport and an appreciation of what it takes to be good at the game.

			</head>
				Fishing has always been a passion of mine. I've fished all over New England, both freshwater and saltwater. I started fishing in my hometown for freshwater fish like Bass, Trout, Pike, Pickeral, Perch and many more. I had multiple small ponds in my town that would be stocked with fish every year. I would frequently visit those different spots after school or on the weekends when I was growing up. As I got older, I found new larger bodies of water with bigger fish to catch. Some of the biggest fish I've ever caught were off my uncles boat, From Stripers to Sea Bass. Fishing in the ocean is a completely different and exciting experiance.
