				Fishing has always been a passion of mine. I've fished all over New England, both freshwater and saltwater. I started fishing in my hometown for freshwater fish like Bass, Trout, Pike, Pickeral, Perch and many more. I had multiple small ponds in my town that would be stocked with fish every year. I would frequently visit those different spots after school or on the weekends when I was growing up. As I got older, I found new larger bodies of water with bigger fish to catch. Some of the biggest fish I've ever caught were off my uncles boat, From Stripers to Sea Bass. Fishing in the ocean is a completely different and exciting experiance.
